# Technology overview

## Automated Machine Learning with Azure Machine Learning
Automated machine learning picks an algorithm and hyperparameters for you and generates a model ready for deployment. There are several options that you can use to configure automated machine learning experiments.

Configuration options available in automated machine learning:

- Select your experiment type: Classification, Regression or Time Series Forecasting
- Data source, formats, and fetch data
- Choose your compute target: local or remote
- Automated machine learning experiment settings
- Run an automated machine learning experiment
- Explore model metrics
- Register and deploy model

You can create and run automated machine learning experiments in code using the [Azure ML Python SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-configure-auto-train) or if you prefer a no code experience, you can also Create your automated machine learning experiments in the [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-create-portal-experiments).

# Quickstart Overview
This quickstart is divided into two parts. In the first part, you learn how to create, run, and explore automated machine learning experiments in the Azure portal without a single line of code. Next, from within the Azure portal, you will register the best trained model, create the deployment image, and deploy a scoring web service on Azure Container Instance (ACI) to make predictions using the registered model. In the second part, you will access the deployed webservice using the Azure ML Python SDK and then test the scoring web service: (1) by make direct calls on service object, (2) by calling the service end point (Scoring URI) over http.

In this quickstart we will be building a regression model to predict Taxi Fares in New York City. We will use a preprocessed labeled training data with features such as number of passengers, trip distance, datetime, holiday information and weather information.

Please complete Part 1 before Part 2.

## Part 1: Automated ML in Azure Portal

# Prerequisites

- If an environment is provided to you. Use the workspace named: `quick-starts-ws-XXXXX`, where `XXXXX` is your unique identifier.

# Exercise 7: Challenge Experiment

In the current experiment, the pipeline of `MaxAbsScaler, RandomForest` gave us the best performing model with the spearman correlation score of: **0.934**. Can you expand the number of iterations for the Automated Machine Learning experiment to see if we can find a better performing model? Note that `Number of iterations` parameter is defined as follows: *In each iteration, a new machine learning model is trained with your data. This is the primary value that affects total run time.*

# Exercise 8: Clean-up

1. Navigate to the `Compute` section in your Azure Portal Workspace and delete your compute target: `auto-ml-compute`
